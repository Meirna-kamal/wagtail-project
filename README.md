# Wagtail Project

## Project Overview

### Multi-Language Home Page

- Each section is implemented using Wagtail's `StreamField` and custom blocks.

### News Page with Image Gallery and Pagination
- A `NewsPage` is implemented to display news articles with images.
- News articles are paginated.
- All news content is managed via the Wagtail admin interface.


### Dynamic Header and Footer Navbars

- You can select any page from the Wagtail admin and assign it a custom title for the header or footer.

## Linting

### 1. How to Run Ruff Linting
To run Ruff linting on your project, execute the following command:

```bash
ruff check .
```
### 2. Ruff Configuration and Rules
The project uses Ruff for linting with the following configuration:

- Target Python Version: The linting is configured for Python 3.9.
- Line Length: The maximum allowed line length is set to 79 characters.

### Linting Rules
- **Types of Issues Selected**:
  - **Errors (E)**: Critical issues that need to be fixed.
  - **Warnings (W)**: Potential problems that should be addressed.
  - **Style and Formatting Issues (F)**: Problems related to code style and formatting.
  - **Complexity Issues (C)**: Concerns about the complexity of the code.

### Excluded Files
Certain files are excluded from linting because they are auto-generated by Django and typically do not require manual linting:
- `wagtail_project/settings/production.py`
- `wagtail_project/settings/dev.py`
- `wagtail_project/settings/base.py`
- `manage.py`
